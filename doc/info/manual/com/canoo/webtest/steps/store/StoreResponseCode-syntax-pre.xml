	<b>Normally, you can safely ignore <key>HTTP</key> response codes while using webtest.
    Any response other than '200' automatically triggers a test failure.
    </b>


    <b>Sometimes however, it is useful to retrieve the response code, e.g. to distinguish
    between server errors (typically code '500'), missing resources (code '404') and security
    issues (typically codes 401 or 403). Or perhaps to verify the messages which these kind of errors
     display to the user. This step allows you to achieve this requirement. In order for webtest
     to forward non-'200' status codes as an error, you need to set an 
     <key>htmlunit</key> option (see below).</b>
