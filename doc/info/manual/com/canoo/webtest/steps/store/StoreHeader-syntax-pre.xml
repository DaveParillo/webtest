    Most of the time, it is more straightforward to simply use the
    <stepref name="verifyHeader"/> step directly.
    The primary rationale for explitly storing a header value in a property
    is to include the property value in a future <stepref name="invoke"/> step,
    or if verification needs to be deferred after the stored response 
    has been replaced  with a new one.
  </b>
  <b>In short, prefer <stepref name="verifyHeader"/> 
    to a <stepref name="storeHeader"/> + <stepref name="verifyProperty"/> combination.
